        <p> Game Description<br></p>
        <p> Best Curve is the best game you´ll ever be allowed to play and our claim to quality doesn´t come from
            nowhere, because we have good lawyers. The aim of this game is to collect points in a race for the
            highscore. You control a red ball which is constantly moving forward, but you can turn left
            or right with either the A or D Keys. While moving, you create a line behind you that will, over the course
            of the game, take over your screen. But you can limit it´s spread by collecting "debuffs". There are two
            Debuffs in total and whenever you pick one up, the other dissappears! Whenever you collect a debuff,
            your line shortens and provides you more freedom to move.
            Furthermore, depending on the amount of the line that got removed, your score rises according to the
            shortened amount. However, be wary of these nasty debuffs, since they can be quite annoying.
            Such as the yellow ball, which inverts the controls, the orange ball, which increases your speed, the white
            ball, which makes you invisible or the pink
            ball, which increases your curve radius. To combat this you can press the SPACE key on a cooldown to create
            a gap in your line. You can't have the same debuff active twice at the same time. Furthermore, after 10
            seconds the debuffs will despawn and respawn. Strive for a
            high score before your own creation overtakes you, representing human civilization metaphorically. If you
            want to return to the start screen you can click the "Best Curve" Icon in the top center of the header.</p>
